## Hi, I am Yiqun 
Welcome to my webiste. A recent graduate from UC Berkeley, I am interested in statistical methodologies driven by real-world applications, especially in public health and genomics. Starting from Fall 2017, I will be a graduate student in Biostatistics at UW Seattle.

In my spare time, I love cooking, baking, hiking and reading.
