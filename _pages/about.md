# About

Yiqun is a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). His dissertation focuses on leveraging toolkits from selective inference to quantify uncertainty in statistical machine learning, an increasingly critical topic in exploration-driven, real-world data analyses. He also has broad interests in applications of rigorous methods in computer science, public health, and biology. Prior to graduate school, Yiqun completed undergraduate degrees in Statistics, Computer Science, and Chemical Biology with higher distinction from the University of California, Berkeley.

<!-- 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in developing rigorous statistical tools motivated by real world datasets and analysis practice. My current interests include:
- Developing valid inference procedures for "double-dipping" practice, and
- Using formal statistical frameworks to (re-)analyze complex datasets, such as network data, computer experiment data, and data collected by complex surveys. -->

<!-- In my spare time, I love cooking, baking, hiking and reading.

# Methodological Research 

## Valid inference after "double-dipping"

## Social Network Analysis

# Applied projects

### Re-visit existing software engineering experiments

### Why and how should Human-computer interaction researchers collect race and ethnicity data?

<!-- ### Ligand affinity prediction using Neural Networks

In a previous life, I was an aspiring biochemist and worked on microcompartments in Salmonella.
