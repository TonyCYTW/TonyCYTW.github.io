# About me

I am a final-year masterâ€™s student in Statistics at the University of Texas at Dallas and Research intern at the McDermott Bioinformatics Lab, UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), advised by Dr. Xing, Chao. I completed my BS Statistics from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan prior to that. 

My primary research interest lies in developing novel graphical models and visualization for high-dimensional and complex data in biological and psychological science applications. Presently I am developing time-varying graphical models which aim to perform network and changepoint estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing trajectory data. 

The other aspect of my project focus on applications of statistics in genomics and public health, where I interact and collaborate with domain experts in UTSW, as well as performimg statistical analysis on their research or data related projects.
