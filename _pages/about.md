## Hi, I am Yiqun 
Welcome to my webiste. I am currently a first year PhD student in Biostatistics at University of Washington, Seattle interested in statistical methodologies driven by real-world applications and datasets. Before moving to Seattle I spent four years at UC Berkeley, learned some mixture of Computer Science, Statistics, and Biochemistry.

<!-- In my spare time, I love cooking, baking, hiking and reading.

## Research Profile

I am extremely grateful to have worked in a few different projects during my undergraduate studies, most recent ones of which are statistical and computational in nature:

### Latent State Models for neuron spiking data

### Towards confident estimation of entropy for HIV amino acids

### Social Network Analysis for SEARCH (Sustainable East Africa Research of Community Health) project 

### Exact Conditional Inference Post-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure selection

<!-- ### Ligand affinity prediction using Neural Networks
 -->

In addition to my current statistical interest, in a previous life I was an aspring biochemist working with Salmonella
### Tuning the Catalytic Activity of Bacterial Microcompartments

## Miscellaneous 

### Life philosophy: 
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. -- Matthew 7.7
### Current reading list:
