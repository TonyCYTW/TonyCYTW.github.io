# About Me
I am a final-year masterâ€™s student in [Statistics at the University of Texas at Dallas](https://nsm.utdallas.edu/) and Research intern at the [McDermott Bioinformatics Lab, UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics-lab/), advised by [Dr. Xing, Chao](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/92824/chao-xing.html). Previously I completed my bachelor degree in [Statistics at National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan](https://www.stat.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en) and was advised by [Dr. Yang, Cheng-Ta](https://psychology.ncku.edu.tw/en/Teacher_Detail.aspx?ID=c3a92ef1-d598-41eb-8211-b2d6b4033957) on my undergraduate thesis.

My primary research interest lies in developing novel graphical models and visualization for high-dimensional and complex data in biological and psychological science applications. Currently I am developing a time-varying graphical framework which aim to perform network and changepoint estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing trajectories. 

The other aspect of my project focus on applications of statistics in genomics and public health, where I interact and collaborate with domain experts in UTSW, as well as perform statistical analysis on their research or data-related projects.
