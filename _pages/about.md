# About Me

I am a second-year master’s student in Statistics at the University of Texas at Dallas. Currently, I am working as a research intern at the [McDermott Bioinformatics Lab, UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics-lab/), advised by [Dr. Xing, Chao](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/92824/chao-xing.html). Previously I completed my bachelor's degree in Statistics at National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, and was advised by [Dr. Yang, Cheng-Ta](https://psychology.ncku.edu.tw/en/Teacher_Detail.aspx?ID=c3a92ef1-d598-41eb-8211-b2d6b4033957) on psychometric study.

My primary research interest lies in developing novel statistical learning methods and visualization for high-dimensional data and dynamical systems in biological and psychological science applications. Currently, I am developing a time-varying graphical framework that aims to perform network and changepoint estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing trajectories. The other aspect of my projects focus on applying statistical analysis in genomics and public health, where I interact and collaborate with domain experts in UTSW.

I am always excited to expore opportunities to collaborate! I am currently looking to **apply for a PhD position** starting in Fall 2023 — feel free to drop me a message via email **(cxh210010 [at] utdallas [dot] edu)**.
