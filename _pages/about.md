## Hi, I am Yiqun 
Welcome to my webiste. A recent graduate from UC Berkeley, I am interested in statistical methodologies driven by real-world applications, especially in public health and genomics. 

Starting from Fall 2017, I will be a graduate student in Biostatistics at UW Seattle.

In my spare time, I love cooking, baking, hiking and reading.

## Research Profile

I am extremely grateful to have worked in a few different projects during my undergraduate studies, most recent ones of which are  statistical and computational in nature:

### Social Network Analysis using data from SEARCH (Sustainable East Africa Research of Community Health) project 

### Exact Conditional Inference Post-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure selection

### Ligand affinity prediction using Neural Networks


Nevertheless, in a previous life I was an aspring biochemist working with Salmonella

#### Tuning the Catalytic Activity of Bacterial Microcompartments

## Miscellaneous 

#### Life philosophy: 
More often than not, you cannot have it all but you can always have a slice of cake instead.

#### Trying to read more: 
Raymond Carver, functional analysis, FATE series
