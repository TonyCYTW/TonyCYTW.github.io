I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at University of Washington, Seattle advised by [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). Before graduate school, I completed my undergraduate studies in Statistics, Computer Science, and Chemical Biology at University of California, Berkeley. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in developing rigorous statistical tools motivated by real-world datasets and analysis practices. Towards this goal, I have been working on the following methodological projects:
* Developing valid inference procedures for hypotheses suggested by the data.

## Research Profile

I am extremely grateful to have worked in a few different projects during my undergraduate studies, most recent ones of which are statistical and computational in nature:

### Latent State Models for neuron spiking data

### Towards confident estimation of entropy for HIV amino acids

### Social Network Analysis for SEARCH (Sustainable East Africa Research of Community Health) project 

### Exact Conditional Inference Post-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure selection

<!-- ### Ligand affinity prediction using Neural Networks
 -->

In addition to my current statistical interest, in a previous life I was an aspring biochemist working with Salmonella
### Tuning the Catalytic Activity of Bacterial Microcompartments

## Miscellaneous 

### Life philosophy: 
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. -- Matthew 7.7
### Current reading list:
