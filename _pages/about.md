# About

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at University of Washington, Seattle advised by [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). Before graduate school, I completed my undergraduate studies in Statistics, Computer Science, and Chemical Biology at University of California, Berkeley. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in developing rigorous statistical tools motivated by real world datasets and analysis practice. My current interests include:
- Developing valid inference procedures for "double-dipping" practice, and
- Using formal statistical frameworks to (re-)analyze complex datasets, such as network data, computer experiment data, and data collected by complex surveys.

<!-- In my spare time, I love cooking, baking, hiking and reading.

# Methodological Research 

## Valid inference after "double-dipping"

## Social Network Analysis

# Applied projects

### Re-visit existing software engineering experiments

### Why and how should Human-computer interaction researchers collect race and ethnicity data?

<!-- ### Ligand affinity prediction using Neural Networks

In a previous life, I was an aspiring biochemist and worked on microcompartments in Salmonella.
