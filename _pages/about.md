# About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at Southern Methodist University. Currently, I am working as a research intern at the [McDermott Bioinformatics Lab, UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics-lab/), advised by [Dr. Xing, Chao](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/92824/chao-xing.html).

My primary research interest lies in developing novel statistical learning methods and visualization techniques for high-dimensional data and dynamical systems, particularly in the fields of biostatistics and psychometrics. Currently, I am working on statistical inference methods to assess replicability success and developing a time-varying graphical framework for network and changepoint estimation in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) pseudotime trajectories. Additionally, my research explores statistical applications in genomics and public health, where I actively collaborate with domain experts at UTSW.

I am always excited to explore new collaboration opportunities! Feel free to reach out via email **(chunyuanh [at] smu [dot] edu)**.
