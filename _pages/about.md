# About me
I am a final-year masterâ€™s student in [Statistics at the University of Texas at Dallas](https://nsm.utdallas.edu/) and Research intern at the [McDermott Bioinformatics Lab, UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics-lab/), advised by [Dr. Xing](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/92824/chao-xing.html), Chao. I completed my BS in Statistics from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan before that. 

My primary research interest lies in developing novel graphical models and visualization for high-dimensional and complex data in biological and psychological science applications. Presently I am developing time-varying graphical models which aim to perform network and changepoint estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing trajectory data. 

The other aspect of my project focus on applications of statistics in genomics and public health, where I interact and collaborate with domain experts in UTSW, as well as perform statistical analysis on their research or data-related projects.
