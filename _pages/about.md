# About
Yiqun Chen (pronunciation [here](./document/yiqunchen_name_recording.mp3)) is a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). His dissertation focuses on leveraging toolkits from selective inference to quantify uncertainty in statistical machine learning. He also has broad interests in applied data analysis and has worked on collaborative projects in computer science, public health, and biology. His work has been published in venues including Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and ASE; in addition, he has received a best paper presentation award at WNAR 2021 and a young investigator award at CROI 2020. Prior to graduate school, Yiqun completed undergraduate degrees in Statistics, Computer Science, and Chemical Biology with higher distinction from the University of California, Berkeley. He has worked at Amazon Search and Waymo LLC as summer interns. 

Yiqun is always excited to learn about opportunities to collaborate and to review --- the best way to reach him is via email **(yiqunc [at] uw [dot] edu)**.

## Quantifying uncertainty in spikes estimated from calcium imaging data
Calcium imaging is an increasingly important class of data from the field of neuroscience. In recent years, a number of methods have been proposed to estimate the times at which a neuron spikes on the basis of calcium imaging data. However, quantifying the uncertainty associated with these estimated spikes remains in part an open problem. In this project, we tackled this problem using a *selective inference* approach. We demonstrate the use of our methods in simulations and real-world, benchmark calcium imaging datasets.

## Social networks and HIV care outcomes in rural Kenya and Uganda
Social isolation among HIV-positive persons might be an important barrier to care. In this project, we used data from the SEARCH Study in rural Kenya and Uganda and constructed 32 community-wide, sociocentric networks. We found that HIV-positive persons named as a contact by fewer people may be at higher risk for poor HIV care outcomes,suggesting opportunities for targeted interventions.

## Revisiting the relationship between fault detection, test adequacy criteria, and test set size
The relationship between fault detection, test adequacy criteria, and test set size remains a complex yet central topic in software engineering research. In this project, we addressed the supposed *contradiction* of prior work and explains why test set size is neither a confounding variable, as previously suggested, nor an independent variable that should be experimentally manipulated. An alternative methodology is proposed for comparing test adequacy criteria on an equal basis, which accounts for test set size without directly manipulating it through unrealistic stratification.
