# About

Yiqun is a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). His dissertation focuses on leveraging toolkits from selective inference to quantify uncertainty in statistical machine learning. He also has broad interests in applied data analysis and has worked on collaborative projects in computer science, public health, and biology. His work has published in venues including Biostatistics, Epidemiology, ASE; in addition, he has received a best paper presentation award at WNAR. Prior to graduate school, Yiqun completed undergraduate degrees in Statistics, Computer Science, and Chemical Biology with higher distinction from the University of California, Berkeley.

## Quantifying uncertainty in spikes estimated from calcium imaging data

Calcium imaging is an increasingly important class of data from the field of neuroscience. In recent years, a number of methods have been proposed to estimate the times at which a neuron spikes on the basis of calcium imaging data. However, quantifying the uncertainty associated with these estimated spikes remains an open problem. In this project, we tackled this problem using a *selective inference* approach.
